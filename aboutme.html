    <h2>Hanuman</h2>
  
    <p> Hanuman is a god and a divine companion of Lord Rama and is a son of Lord Vayu.Hanuman could increase his strength,energy and size if needed.
      My superpower is my strength to adopt to the situations that I face in my life. I always find Hanuman as my Idol when ever I feel low
      I think about the situations that my idol goes through.</p>
